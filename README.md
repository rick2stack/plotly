## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an interative website to visualize bacterial data for each volunteer in the Belly Button Bacteria Study.  The website filters out by the volunteers ID and displays three (3) graphs.  

1. The first graph shows the top 10 bacterias found on the respective volunteer.  
2. The second graph is a gauge type graph which shows the amount of times the volunteer washes their belly button a week. 
3. The last graph shows the total amount of bacteria by each specific bacteria (OTU ID).
